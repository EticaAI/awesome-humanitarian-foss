## Criteria

**The minimal requirements for software added to this list are**:

- The software must have at least one version [licensed as open source](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source).
- The software must have **public** repository using Git version control system and able to accept pull requests.
- The software must focus on some humanitarian application or have a specific internal team who works on humanitarian applications of the software

**What is not considered**:
- Code quality.
- Lack of technical expertise to explain the software when receiving external help

<!--

**Additional aspects considered**:
As this list is geared toward technology experts aiming to contribute to open
source with humanitarian impact with their skill, not for financial support or
as suggestion for software end users:

- The development should still active or open to contributions
    - _Open question: how do define "active" / "open to contributions"?_

-->

## Acknowledgements

### Acknowledgement 1

_TODO: give a short acknowledgement considering both developers and project
maintainers that open source in general is a challenge to maintain (fititnt, 2018-04-18 11:00 BRT)_
