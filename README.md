## Selection Criteria

As this list is geared toward technology experts aiming to contribute to open
source with humanitarian impact with their skill, not for financial support or
as suggestion for software end users:

- The links to HFOSS should point to public versioned code
- The development should still active or open to contributions
    - _Open question: how do define "active" / "open to contributions"?_

## How to contribute

Make a public suggestion at [awesome-humanitarian-foss/issues](https://github.com/fititnt/awesome-humanitarian-foss/issues)
or send and email to <rocha@ieee.org>.
