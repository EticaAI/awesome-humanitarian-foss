## Organizations
_The **main goal** of the following active organizations is developing or
promoting HFOSS development._

<!--
NOTE: for reference, if we remove "Humaniarian" from "HFOSS", it is well known
      that companies that individually contribute more to FOSS are private
      companies like Microsoft, Google, Red Hat, IBM, Intell... ref

## Criteria

**The minimal requirements for software added to this list are**:

- The software must have at least one version [licensed as open source](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source).
- The software must have **public** repository using Git version control system and able to accept pull requests.
- The software must focus on some humanitarian application or have a specific internal team who works on humanitarian applications of the software

**What is not considered**:
- Code quality.
- Lack of technical expertise to explain the software when receiving external help

<!--

**Additional aspects considered**:
As this list is geared toward technology experts aiming to contribute to open
source with humanitarian impact with their skill, not for financial support or
as suggestion for software end users:

- The development should still active or open to contributions
    - _Open question: how do define "active" / "open to contributions"?_
